  The beautiful Swan Lake Screensaver provides a tranquil, relaxing atmosphere
in your home or office during the times that your computer is not otherwise
being used.  Watch peacefully as families of graceful swans float lazily around
the shores of a pristine mountain lake, modeled after the scenic views of the
Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA.  Listen to soothing sounds of nature accompa-
nied by the soft melody of "Le Cygne (The Swan)" by French composer Camille
Saint-Saens, one of the most beautiful songs ever written.  Swimming turtles,
splashing fish, chirping songbirds, darting dragonflies, and soaring eagles
complete the ambiance and make Swan Lake one of the most wonderfully refreshing
screensavers ever created.

  The lake scene is fully customizable, depending upon your preferences, by
means of an easy-to-use configuration menu.  As with all WaveBreak Software
products, this screensaver contains NO ADWARE, NO SPYWARE, or other HIDDEN
SOFTWARE, which are common annoyances found in many of the "free" screensavers
and games that are available for download today.  Our software is of the highest
quality, and we at WaveBreak Software refuse to bombard our valued customers
with these nuisances.

  This software is distributed as SHAREWARE.  The basic shareware premise is
"try before you buy," which is obviously the most natural and comfortable way
to purchase any product.  Few people would buy a car without taking it for a
test drive or purchase a tool without seeing what it does, and software is no
exception to this rule.  The shareware principle allows a software product to
be installed and used, with some limitations, before any money is exchanged.
If the software runs properly and is useful to the consumer, then the fully-
functional version can be purchased and installed, with little or no risk to
the purchaser of having software they do not need or cannot use.

  * Running the screensaver in "priority mode" causes some problems with back-
    ground applications.  Most notably, all networking operations are slowed
    down considerably.  On a stand-alone system, this is not a problem, but if
    the computer is being used as a print server or as the gateway for a shared
    Internet connection, all users attempting to use these network services will
    be hindered.  On some systems, this setting also interferes with the proper
    operation of the audio system, resulting in unsteady audio playback while
    the screensaver is running.  This setting also causes some background
    applications to temporarily stop responding.  These issues are related to
    the way that Windows schedules events and are not considered to be a bug by
    WaveBreak Software.  The user is warned that these problems may occur if
    the "priority mode" setting is enabled.

  * Occasionally, when the screensaver exits, applications that were running in
    maximized mode will be displayed at a smaller size in the upper-left corner
    of the desktop.  This has been confirmed as a problem with the DirectX API
    and can be found in a number of DirectX applications.  A number of steps
    have been taken by our programmers to prevent this problem, though it does
    still occur occasionally depending upon the system configuration.
