			<Char_Desc_2000>The beautiful Swan Lake Screensaver provides a tranquil, relaxing atmosphere in your home or office during the times that your computer is not otherwise being used.  Watch peacefully as families of graceful swans float lazily around the shores of a pristine mountain lake, modeled after the scenic views of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA.  Listen to soothing sounds of nature accompanied by the soft melody of "Le Cygne (The Swan)" by French composer Camille Saint-Saens, one of the most beautiful songs ever written.  Swimming turtles, splashing fish, chirping songbirds, darting dragonflies, and soaring eagles complete the ambiance and make Swan Lake one of the most wonderfully refreshing screensavers ever created.

The lake scene is fully customizable, depending upon your preferences, by means of an easy-to-use configuration menu.  As with all WaveBreak Software products, this screensaver contains NO ADWARE, NO SPYWARE, or other HIDDEN SOFTWARE, which are common annoyances found in many of the "free" screensavers and games that are available for download today.  Our software is of the highest quality, and we at WaveBreak Software refuse to bombard our valued customers with these nuisances.

This software is distributed as SHAREWARE.  The basic shareware premise is "try before you buy," which is obviously the most natural and comfortable to way to purchase any product.  Few people would buy a car without taking it for a test drive or purchase a tool without seeing what it does, and software is no exception to this rule.  The shareware principle allows a software product to be installed and used, with some limitations, before any money is exchanged.  If the software runs properly and is useful to the consumer, then the fully-functional version can be purchased and installed, with little or no risk to the purchaser of having software they do not need or cannot use.
