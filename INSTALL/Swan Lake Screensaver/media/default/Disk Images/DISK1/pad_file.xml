			<Char_Desc_2000>The beautiful Swan Lake Screensaver provides a tranquil, relaxing atmosphere in your home or office during the times that your computer is not otherwise being used.  Watch peacefully as families of graceful swans float lazily around the shores of a pristine mountain lake, modeled after the scenic views of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA.  Listen to soothing sounds of nature accompanied by the soft melody of "Le Cygne (The Swan)" by French composer Camille Saint-Saens, one of the most beautiful songs ever written.  Swimming turtles, splashing fish, chirping songbirds, darting dragonflies, and soaring eagles complete the ambiance and make Swan Lake one of the most wonderfully refreshing screensavers ever created.

The lake scene is fully customizable, depending upon your preferences, by means of an easy-to-use configuration menu.  As with all WaveBreak Software products, this screensaver contains NO ADWARE, NO SPYWARE, or other HIDDEN SOFTWARE, which are common annoyances found in many of the "free" screensavers and games that are available for download today.  Our software is of the highest quality, and we at WaveBreak Software refuse to bombard the public with these nuisances.</Char_Desc_2000>
